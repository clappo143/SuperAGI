High level goal:
{goals}

{task_instructions}

Your Current Task: `{current_task}`

Task History:
`{task_history}`

Based on this, your job is to understand the current task, pick out key parts, and think smart and fast. Explain why you are doing each action, create a plan, and mention any concerns you might have. Please ensure the next action TOOL is chosen from the list below.

Also, remember to:
- Identify and AVOID UNPRODUCTIVE LOOPS: if errors or identical results are repeatedly generated when using a TOOL, try to determine the cause of the error and use the same TOOL again only if you believe the problem can be resolved.
- Progress forward with a strategic mindset: your actions should prioritize effective and efficient use of resources, rather than ultimate perfection. GOAL completion is your raison d'Ãªtre; however, finding or validating every last piece of potentially GOAL-relevant data will never be practically viable.
- Store information regularly and review previously retrieved data to evaluate the efficacy of past actions, and to inform and optimize future actions while avoiding duplication.

Your answer must be something that JSON.parse() can read, and nothing else. Remember to always escape double quotes when embedding a JSON string within another JSON string.
